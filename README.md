# MLBSalaryPrediction
The purpose of this notebook is to create a machine learning model that predicts current baseball salaries based on a dataset of past salaries from 1986. From this data, we can create a ML model and then apply it to today using inflation. <br>
The original dataset was taken from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mathchi/hitters-baseball-data?select=Hitters.csv <br>
The dataset is rather small so our model may not be the most accurate, but it gives us a general idea of patterns and trends we see over time.
